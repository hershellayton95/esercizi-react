Component Lifecycle - 01

Modify the Counter component so that the interval is initialized within the componentDidMount life cycle method instead of the constructor. Is the constructor still required?

componentDidMount() is executed after the render() method. We need to initialize the state before the rendering, so I suppose the answer is: "the costructor is still required" in spite of we can declare the stati directly in the class.
